A ROS Client Library implementation in Dart

Heavily inspired by the cpp and especially [nodejs](https://github.com/RethinkRobotics-opensource/rosnodejs) implementations*

See the examples folder for examples, until I have time to create a better Readme and documentation.














* I did not directly use any of the nodejs source code since this is an implementation in a different language using different libraries.
However, I want to make sure I attribute them properly, since a large portion of the code is structured similarly, and I used their
implementation as a reference. You can find their license included in the source code of this library.
